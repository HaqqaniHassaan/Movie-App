# Movie Emporium ðŸŽ¬

Welcome to **Movie Emporium**, a sleek and modern React web application that allows users to search for movies using the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/). This project demonstrates an efficient use of modern web development techniques, including React hooks, asynchronous API calls, and clean CSS for a polished user interface. This project is perfect for anyone looking to showcase their skills in front-end web development, API integration, and user-friendly UI design.

## Setup Instructions

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-emporium.git
   cd movie-emporium
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open in your browser**:
   The app should automatically open in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`. If it doesn't, simply visit this address manually.

5. **API Key Setup**:
   Make sure to sign up for a free OMDb API key at [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx). Update the `API_URL` in `App.js` with your API key like so:

   ```js
   const API_URL = "http://www.omdbapi.com?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY";
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, follow these steps to interact with it:

1. **Search for a Movie**: Type the name of a movie into the search bar and either hit enter or click the search icon.
2. **View Search Results**: If the movie exists in the OMDb database, you will see the results appear in a grid layout. Each result is presented as a movie card with a poster and title.
3. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: If no results are found, a "No Movies Found" message will be displayed.

## Code Structure

This project is structured to promote scalability and separation of concerns. Below is an overview of key files:

- **`App.js`**: Contains the main logic for fetching movie data and rendering the UI.
- **`MovieCard.jsx`**: A reusable component for displaying individual movie details.
- **`index.js`**: The entry point of the application, rendering the `App` component.

### Highlights:
- **Hooks**: React hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect` are used to manage state and handle API calls.
- **Asynchronous Data Fetching**: The `searchMovies` function utilizes the `fetch` API to make asynchronous requests to the OMDb API.

---

## API Integration

The app interacts with the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to retrieve movie information.

### How it works:
- **API Endpoint**: The application makes GET requests to the OMDb API using the endpoint: `http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=[yourkey]&s=[searchterm]`.
- **Data Handling**: The results from the API are stored in the state using React's `useState` and rendered dynamically within the UI.

---

## UI/UX Design

Movie Emporium is built with a focus on delivering an intuitive and visually engaging experience to users.

- **Font Choice**: The application uses `Roboto Slab` and `Raleway` to achieve a modern, professional look.
- **Color Scheme**: A combination of dark backgrounds with light-colored text creates a minimalist and user-friendly design.
- **Responsive Design**: The app adjusts seamlessly for mobile and desktop views, ensuring users can enjoy it on any device.

### Custom CSS Highlights:
- **Flexbox & Grid Layout**: These techniques are used throughout to ensure that elements are aligned correctly and adapt to screen size changes.
- **Hover Effects**: The movie cards have subtle hover effects, enhancing user interactivity and giving the app a professional feel.
